With more than 120,000 graduates, the Interaction Design Foundation is the biggest online design school globally.
We were founded in 2002.


We‚Äôre market leaders in online design education because the world‚Äôs leading experts create our content and because we‚Äôre specialized in design.
Our courses cover the entire spectrum of UX design from beginner to advanced.


# Our Main Product

YWe're constantly improving and expanding our main product ‚Äî a web application with online courses, bootcamps and community tools. The architecture is a multi-page application ‚Äî an MVC-based, modular monolith using Laravel as a back-end framework. It was started back in 2013, and since then we‚Äôve relentlessly increased code quality, features and test coverage, and are proud to say that we have almost zero legacy code or technical debt. We believe a modular monolithic architecture can reach a level of perfection where it‚Äôs superior to a micro-service architecture ‚Äî despite an ever-increasing number of features.


# ‚öôÔ∏è Our Stack

Here, on GitHub we write code with ‚ù§Ô∏è. Our main stack is:

- PHP 8.1 and Laravel 8 (always the latest versions)
- Vanilla JavaScript (incl. Web Components) and Vue.js for Laravel Nova
- Server: Docker, nginx
- DBs: MySQL, Redis
- Testing: PHPUnit, Laravel Dusk, cypress.io
- Cloud: Amazon S3, CloudFront
- CI/CD: GitHub actions + Deployer

We love to delegate boring tasks to our non-human colleagues ‚Äî like static analysers (Psalm, PHPStan, Rector), bots, scripts, and test code.
