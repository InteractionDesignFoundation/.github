# 👤 Who are the IxDF?

The Interaction Design Foundation (IxDF) is the biggest online design school globally. Founded in 2002, we have over 120,000 graduates and counting. We’re market leaders in online design education because the world’s leading experts create our content and because we’re specialized in design. What’s more, with over 1.5 million monthly visitors, we’re at the forefront of providing premier design education to such organizations as IBM and SAP, as well as thousands of other companies. 

# 🌎 We're a remote-first organization with regular team trips
We were an all-remote organization before that term even existed. We only work with paid, full-time, remote staff. We have daily video-based contact with our colleagues and meet each other physically on team trips a few times per year. You can [read more about our work culture](https://www.interaction-design.org/about/careers).

# 🏠 Our Main Product

We're constantly improving and expanding our main product — a web application with online courses, bootcamps and community tools. The architecture is a multi-page application — an MVC-based, modular monolith using Laravel as a back-end framework. It was started back in 2013, and since then we’ve relentlessly increased code quality, features and test coverage, and are proud to say that we have almost zero legacy code or technical debt. We believe a modular monolithic architecture can reach a level of perfection where it’s superior to a micro-service architecture — despite an ever-increasing number of features.

# ⚙️ Our Stack

#UseThePlatform. We focus on enduring technologies over the latest fleeting frameworks so that our developers' knowledge continually grows instead of becoming outdated after each trend has passed. This philosophy allows us to build robust, maintainable and beautiful code that stands the test of time rather than chasing the latest hype. Some of our key technologies include: 

- Always latest PHP and Laravel versions
- Modular monolith comprising 30+ bounded contexts
- Laravel ecosystem: Horizon, Nova, Scout, Pennant, Passport, Inertia, and more
- Web Components, Htmx, Tailwind, Vue.js, Inertia.js, Vite
- Server: Docker, Sail, Octane, Forge, nginx
- DBs: MySQL 8, Redis
- Testing: PHPUnit, Pest, Cypress
- Advanced CI/CD: GitHub actions, Deployer, Bash
- Code Quality: Psalm, PHPStan, Rector, PHPCS, PHP CS Fixer
- Integrations: Stripe, PayPal, Amazon Pay, Twilio, Mailgun, MailerLite, GitHub, Forge, Coconut, ImageKit, and more 
- Cloud: AWS, Digital Ocean
- APM & Monitoring: NewRelic, CloudWatch, BugSnag, GTMetrix 

We love to delegate boring tasks to our non-human colleagues — like static analysers (Psalm, PHPStan, Rector), bots, scripts, and test code.

# ❤️ Why do devs love to work with us?

Are you an awesome PHP developer who is **looking for a truly challenging role** in a growing dev team?
Do you wish to **use your coding superpowers for a good cause** and help improve the lives of millions of people around the world?
Do you want to work with **a team that values your insights and contributions** to a dynamic product with an exciting future? 

This is a **rare opportunity** to work exclusively with senior-level professionals in a diverse, highly-organized, result-driven environment where you can **thrive personally and professionally**.
We’ve gone above and beyond to carve this role into a unique dev position, where all the things that made your previous job suck are gone.

Here, you’ll never have to advocate for the **importance of investing in code quality** - our founder is a coder himself, and our **elegant code** is the vein that keeps the IxDF healthy and growing.
We understand how critical your superpowers are, and don’t believe in making our dev team work on pointless tasks, nor suffer the consequences of technical decisions being made by people in other departments (we know you’ve been there).
Instead, you’ll **work on stimulating projects** in a healthy, collaborative environment where **your ideas and time are valued**.
You’ll be involved in decision-making processes which means there are incredible possibilities for you to **take initiative and grow** here.
In fact, it’s encouraged! Traditional hierarchies don’t lead to brilliant, effective outcomes, so we’ve thrown them out. 

We’re proud to say that **we’ve put together an amazing team of unicorns** who support, inspire and challenge each other every day, and **we are looking for equally talented and like-minded PHP developers to join us**.
We’re lucky enough to get up each day and **build a better future for thousands of people** around the world.
But something’s missing. And we think it could be you.
