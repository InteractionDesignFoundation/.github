Our courses cover the entire spectrum of UX design from beginner to advanced.

Universities such as MIT and the University of Cambridge include our material in their curricula.

We’ve created the world’s biggest and most authoritative library of open-source UX Design literature
with such noted authors as Don Norman and Clayton Christensen.


### ⚙️ Developers

Here, on GitHub we build with ❤️ love our main product — online courses platform. Our main stack is:

 - PHP/Laravel (always latest versions)
 - Redis, MySQL

 - Web Components, PostCSS (to maximise usage of native platform features) and Vue.js.

We love to delegate boring tasks to computers (static analysers (Psalm, PHPStan, Rector), bots, scripts, testing).
